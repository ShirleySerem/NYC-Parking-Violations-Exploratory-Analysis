# NYC-Parking-Violations-Exploratory-Analysis

## Description
This is an exploratory analysis on NYC Parking Violations dataset using Pandas and Numpy


## Project Context
The NYC Department of Finance collects data on every parking ticket issued in NYC (~10M per year!). This data is made publicly available to aid in ticket resolution and to guide policymakers. For this project we will use a dataset of 50,000 parking violations issued in New York City during the 2021 fiscal year. The dataset was created in January 2021 and contains data from April 1 to November 30, 2020 sourced from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2023/pvqr-7yc4).

I installed pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries.
